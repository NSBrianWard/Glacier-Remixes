Glacier--Remixes-
=================

Stayed up all night and got @joeyfigaro's wonderful Glacier theme working for Vim, Xcode, and OS X's Terminal.app. There are some color syncing issues, but it's a place to start!

For the original Sublime Text theme, go to http://glaciertheme.com. For Atom UI and syntax themes, go to https://atom.io/packages/glacier-ui and here https://atom.io/packages/glacier-syntax.
